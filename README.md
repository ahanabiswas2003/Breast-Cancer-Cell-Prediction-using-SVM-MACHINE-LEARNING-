Support Vector Machines (SVM) are a powerful tool for predicting breast cancer cell malignancy in machine learning. SVM works by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates data points of different classes—in this case, malignant and benign cells—based on their features. For breast cancer prediction, SVM uses a set of features extracted from cell images or patient data, such as cell size, shape, and texture. By mapping these features into a high-dimensional space, SVM can create a decision boundary that maximizes the margin between classes. This approach is particularly effective for handling complex and non-linear relationships in the data, leading to accurate and robust predictions when properly tuned and validated.
